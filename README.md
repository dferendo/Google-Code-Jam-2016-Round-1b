Problem was tackled by finding a unique letter for each number. The pattern was the following: "ZERO", "SIX", "EIGHT", "THREE", "FOUR", "FIVE", "SEVEN", "TWO", "ONE", "NINE". The unique letters were: 'Z', 'X', 'G', 'H', 'R', 'F', 'V', 'W', 'O', 'N'. Some precautions were made for repeating letters in a word(Three and seven)
